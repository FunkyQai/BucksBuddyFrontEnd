# BucksBuddy - Portfolio Manager App

This is the React frontend for my final year project, BucksBuddy. It's a portfolio manager app designed to help users manage their investments.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/FunkyQai/BucksBuddyFrontEnd.git


2. Install the dependencies

cd BucksBuddyFrontEnd
npm install


## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
