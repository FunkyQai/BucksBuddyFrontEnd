# Description

This is the React frontend for my final year project, BucksBuddy. It's a portfolio manager app designed to help users manage their investments.


## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FunkyQai/BucksBuddyFrontEnd.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd BucksBuddyFrontEnd
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
